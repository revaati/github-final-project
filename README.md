Simple Interest Calculator
Description
This project is a Simple Interest Calculator that calculates the interest earned based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic GitHub usage and simple financial calculations using code.

How It Works
The calculator uses the simple interest formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Usage
Enter the principal amount
Enter the rate of interest
Enter the time period (in years)
The calculator returns the calculated simple interest
Example
